# completejourney (development version)

  * Updates TBD

# completejourney 1.1.0 (2019-09-28)

## New features

  * Added an internet check with `curl::has_internet()` and condition handling to 
    provide informative error when downloading online data sets.

## Bug fixes

  * Removed `^data$` from .Rbuildignore and only specified ignoring the .rds 
    files. This resolved issue ([#14](https://github.com/bradleyboehmke/completejourney/issues/14)). 
    As a consequence, the package was too large now that the build included the 
    required data sets so I downsampled the `transactions_sample` and 
    `promotions_sample` data sets.
